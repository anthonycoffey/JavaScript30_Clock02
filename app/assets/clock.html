  <h1>Hello!</h1>
  <p>My name is Anthony Coffey and I'm a software engineer based in Austin, Texas.</p>
  <p>I was inspired to take the #JavaScript30 challenge, but I wanted to make things a little more interesting so I decided to use a different framework or technology for each project as an added challenge.</p>
  <h3>NativeScript, you say?!</h3>
  <p>Yes! This clock was created using Vue-NativeScript, which is an awesome library that allows you to use Vue with NativeScript.</p>
  <p>If you'd like to learn more about Vue-NativeScript then visit nativescript-vue.org</p>
