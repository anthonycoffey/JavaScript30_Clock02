# Vue-NativeScript Useless Clock

> A useless clock built with Vue-NativeScript, bootstrapped with Vue CLI.

For this project, I used JavaScript Date() methods with Vue's reactivity system to display the current time down to the second.

Yes, it is trivial to build a clock app on a device that shows the time in the top corner, but I was inspired by a prompt from the JavaScript 30 day challenge. Instead of using just plain JavaScript I wanted to try building with a technology I've never worked with before. VERY NICE! :borat voice:

## Usage

``` bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Check configuration
tns doctor

# Build for production
tns build <platform> --bundle

# Build, watch for changes and debug the application
tns debug <platform> --bundle

# Build, watch for changes and run the application
tns run <platform> --bundle
```
