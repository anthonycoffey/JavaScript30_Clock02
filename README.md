# Vue-NativeScript Clock

> A simple clock built with Vue-NativeScript, bootstrapped with Vue CLI.

For this project, I used JavaScript Date() methods with Vue's reactivity system to display the current time down to the second.

## Usage

``` bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build for production
tns build <platform> --bundle

# Build, watch for changes and debug the application
tns debug <platform> --bundle

# Build, watch for changes and run the application
tns run <platform> --bundle
```
